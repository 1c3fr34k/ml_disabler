GUI for stopping and starting the MSI MysticLight Service in Windows.

# What does it do
As stated in the title its a little application programmed in python to stop and start the MSI MysticLight components, avoiding them to interfer with anti-cheat programs.

#Goal
Just saving time because you dont have to manually stop them in the task manager of windows.
